> /Figma-Tokens:tasks:facilitate-brainstorming-session is running… 

⏺ I'm ready to facilitate a brainstorming session with you! Let me start by
  understanding the context and goals.

  Session Setup

  Let me ask you 4 questions to set us up for success:

  1. What are we brainstorming about?
  (What's the topic, problem, or opportunity you want to explore?)

  2. Any constraints or parameters?
  (Budget limits, timeline, technical requirements, must-haves, must-avoid?)

  3. Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation?
  (Are we casting a wide net to see what's possible, or narrowing in on
  specific solutions?)

  4. Do you want a structured document output to reference later?
  (I can capture all our ideas and insights in an organized document -
  Default is Yes)

  Take your time with these - your answers will help me tailor the perfect
  brainstorming approach for you!

⏺ What is Figma-Tokens-Method?

  FIGMA-TOKENS-METHOD™ stands for Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven 
  Development. It's a framework that combines AI agents with Agile
  development methodologies to help you build software projects from idea to
   deployment.

  Core Concept: "Vibe CEO"

  Figma-Tokens transforms you into a "Vibe CEO" - you provide the vision and make
  decisions, while specialized AI agents handle the implementation details.
  Think of it as directing a team of expert AI agents, each mastering a
  specific role.

  The Specialized Agent Team

  The framework provides 8 core agents for different roles:

  | Agent     | Role               | Handles                               |
  |-----------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
  | analyst   | Business Analyst   | Market research, competitive analysis |
  | pm        | Product Manager    | PRDs, feature prioritization          |
  | architect | Solution Architect | System design, technical architecture |
  | dev       | Developer          | Code implementation, debugging        |
  | qa        | QA/Test Architect  | Test strategies, quality gates        |
  | ux-expert | UX Designer        | UI/UX design, prototypes              |
  | po        | Product Owner      | Story validation, document alignment  |
  | sm        | Scrum Master       | Story creation, sprint planning       |

  Plus meta-agents like figma-tokens-master and figma-tokens-orchestrator for coordination.

  Two-Phase Approach

  Phase 1: Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)

  - Use large context windows (like Gemini's 1M tokens)
  - Generate PRDs and Architecture documents
  - Leverage multiple agents for brainstorming
  - Cost-effective for big documents

  Phase 2: Development (IDE - Implementation)

  - Shard documents into manageable pieces
  - Execute focused SM → Dev → QA cycles
  - One story at a time, sequential progress
  - Real-time file operations and testing

  The Development Loop

  1. SM Agent → Creates next story from sharded docs
  2. You → Review and approve story
  3. Dev Agent → Implements approved story
  4. QA Agent → Reviews and refactors code
  5. You → Verify completion
  6. Repeat until complete

  Why It Works

  - Context Optimization: Clean chats = better AI performance
  - Role Clarity: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality
  - Incremental Progress: Small stories = manageable complexity
  - Human Oversight: You validate each step = quality control
  - Document-Driven: Specs guide everything = consistency

  You're currently in a brainstorming session via the
  /facilitate-brainstorming-session command. Would you like to:

  1. Continue with the brainstorming session setup I started earlier?
  2. Learn more about specific aspects of Figma-Tokens?
  3. Get help with installing or using Figma-Tokens?

  Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

> can we create an AI driven chatbot plugin for figma that can integrate the
 Figma-Tokens methord directly in figma. The goal is to reduce the techincal steps 
involved in setting up the Figma-Tokens process and help non technical people 
provide the access to the Figma-Tokens method. The Plugin will act as a chat bot and
 will have a simple UI that enables the user to use all the aspects of the 
Figma-Tokens method similar to Claude, ChatGPT etc. We can use an API key from 
Claude Code to integrate and get the plugin running. 

⏺ This is an excellent idea! A Figma plugin for Figma-Tokens would be a game-changer
   for democratizing access to the framework, especially for designers, PMs,
   and non-technical stakeholders who already live in Figma. Let me help you
   plan this out.

⏺ ✅ Technical Feasibility: YES, This is Definitely Doable!

  Why This Works Perfectly:

  1. Figma Plugin Capabilities
    - Full UI support with React/HTML/CSS
    - Can make external API calls
    - Local storage for user data and documents
    - Export capabilities for generated documents
  2. Figma-Tokens is Prompt-Based
    - All Figma-Tokens agents are essentially sophisticated prompts
    - Can be packaged into the plugin
    - No complex runtime dependencies
  3. Claude API Integration
    - Anthropic provides API access (not "Claude Code" - that's the CLI
  tool)
    - You'd use the Claude API (Anthropic API)
    - Supports streaming for real-time chat experience

  🎯 Core Value Proposition

  "Figma-Tokens in Figma" would enable:
  - Designers to create PRDs and user stories alongside their designs
  - PMs to spec features without leaving their workflow
  - Non-technical founders to generate complete project documentation
  - Design teams to validate UX decisions with the UX Expert agent
  - Seamless handoff from design to development with docs attached
